What I have developed ("Tweaked"); in this game is the CPU opponent, start menu, radio buttons and music.
\
The base for this project is mainly from two interesting sources that deserve a lot of cred:  

\
Bro Code's YouTube channel which provides the basis of the Pong template:

\
For the opponent, I got inspired by the guide from Kevin Olson\

\
The Game plays "Pretty Good" and I'll provide the .jar so you can try it out yourself.


Issues & future re-work : 

Reset the Score and game state after going back to the menu.
Making sure the game only starts after the GameMenu selection and not before. 
As of now, you can "cheat" between AI and Human player during the game.
